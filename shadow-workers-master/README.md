# Shadow Workers

## Info
Shadow Workers is a free and open source C2 and proxy designed for penetration testers to help in the exploitation of XSS and malicious Service Workers (SW).
A successful exploitation allows you to browse on the targeted application as the victim(s), as long as the SW (agent) is active. A victim does not have to have a browser tab open in the application for the agent to be active.
